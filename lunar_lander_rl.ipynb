        "\n",
        "Simpler tabular methods are limited to discrete observation spaces, meaning there are a finite number of possible states. In `LunarLander-v2` however, we're dealing with a continuous range of states across 8 different parameters, meaning there are a near-infinite number of possible states. We could try to bin similar values into groups, but due to the sensitive controls of the game, even slight errors can lead to significant missteps.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get around this, we'll use a `neural network Q-function approximator`. This lets us predict the best actions to take for a given state, even when dealing with a vast number of potential states. It's a much better match for our complex landing challenge.\n",

        "The algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Begin by initializing the parameters for two neural networks, $Q(s,a)$ (referred to as the online network) and $\\hat{Q}(s,a)$ (known as the target network), with random weights. Both networks serve the function of mapping a state-action pair to a Q-value, which is an estimate of the expected return from that pair. Also, set the exploration probability $\\epsilon$ to 1.0, and create an empty replay buffer to store past transition experiences.\n",
        "2. **Action Selection**: Utilize an epsilon-greedy strategy for action selection. With a probability of $\\epsilon$, select a random action $a$, but in all other instances, choose the action $a$ that maximizes the Q-value, i.e., $a = argmax_aQ(s,a)$.\n",
        "3. **Experience Collection**: Execute the chosen action $a$ within the environment emulator and observe the resulting immediate reward $r$ and the next state $s'$.\n",
        "4. **Experience Storage**: Store the transition $(s,a,r,s')$ in the replay buffer for future reference.\n",
        "5. **Sampling**: Randomly sample a mini-batch of transitions from the replay buffer for training the online network.\n",
        "6. **Target Computation**: For every transition in the sampled mini-batch, compute the target value $y$. If the episode has ended at this step, $y$ is simply the reward $r$. Otherwise, $y$ is the sum of the reward and the discounted estimated optimal future Q-value, i.e.,  $y = r + \\gamma \\max_{a' \\in A} \\hat{Q}(s', a')$\n",
        "7. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the loss, which is the squared difference between the Q-value predicted by the online network and the computed target, i.e., $\\mathcal{L} = (Q(s,a) - y)^2$\n",
        "8. **Online Network Update**: Update the parameters of the online network $Q(s,a)$ using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the loss.\n",
        "9. **Target Network Update**: Every $N$ steps, update the target network by copying the weights from the online network to the target network $\\hat{Q}(s,a)$.\n",
        "10. **Iterate**: Repeat the process from step 2 until convergence.\n",

It is particularly useful when there is a need for fast append and pop operations from either end of the container, which it provides at O(1) time complexity. In contrast, a list offers these operations at O(n) time complexity, making the deque a preferred choice in cases that necessitate more efficient operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, a deque allows setting a maximum size. Once this maximum size is exceeded during an insertion (push) operation at the front, the deque automatically ejects the item at the rear, thereby maintaining its maximum length.\n",

        "In the replay buffer, the `push` method is utilized to add an experience. If adding this experience exceeds the maximum buffer size, the oldest (rear-most) experience is automatically removed. This approach ensures that the replay buffer always contains the most recent experiences up to its capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `sample` method, on the other hand, is used to retrieve a random batch of experiences from the replay buffer. This randomness is critical in breaking correlations within the sequence of experiences, which leads to more robust learning.\n",

        "### Define the DQN Agent\n",
        "The DQN agent handles the interaction with the environment, selecting actions, collecting experiences, storing them in the replay buffer, and using these experiences to train the network. Let's walk through each part of this process:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Initialisation\n",
        "The `__init__` function sets up the agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `self.device`: We start by checking whether a GPU is available, and, if so, we use it, otherwise, we fall back to CPU.\n",
        "- `self.gamma`: This is the discount factor for future rewards, used in the Q-value update equation.\n",
        "- `self.batch_size`: This is the number of experiences we'll sample from the memory when updating the model.\n",
        "- `self.q_network` and `self.target_network`: These are two instances of the Q-Network. The first is the network we're actively training, and the second is a copy that gets updated less frequently. This helps to stabilize learning.\n",
        "- `self.optimizer`: This is the optimization algorithm used to update the Q-Network's parameters.\n",
        "- `self.memory`: This is a replay buffer that stores experiences. It's an instance of the `ReplayBuffer` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step Function\n",
        "The `step` function is called after each timestep in the environment:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The function starts by storing the new experience in the replay buffer.\n",
        "- If enough experiences have been stored, it calls `self.update_model()`, which triggers a learning update.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Action Selection\n",
        "The act function is how the agent selects an action:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a randomly drawn number is greater than $\\epsilon$, it selects the action with the highest predicted Q-value. This is known as exploitation: the agent uses what it has learned to select the best action.\n",
        "- If the random number is less than $\\epsilon$, it selects an action randomly. This is known as exploration: the agent explores the environment to learn more about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Model Update\n",
        "The `update_model` function is where the learning happens:\n",
        "\n",
        "- It starts by sampling a batch of experiences from the replay buffer.\n",
        "- It then calculates the current Q-values for the sampled states and actions, and the expected - Q-values based on the rewards and next states.\n",
        "- It calculates the loss, which is the mean squared difference between the current and expected Q-values.\n",
        "- It then backpropagates this loss through the Q-Network and updates the weights using the optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Target Network Update\n",
        "Finally, the `update_target_network` function copies the weights from the Q-Network to the Target Network. This is done periodically (not every step), to stabilize the learning process. Without this, the Q-Network would be trying to follow a moving target, since it's learning from estimates produced by itself."

        "The Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm is a modification of the standard Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, which reduces the overestimation bias in the Q-values, thereby improving the stability of the learning process. You can read the original publication by Hasselt et al from late 2015 here:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### The DDQN Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Similar to DQN, initialize the parameters of two neural networks, $Q(s,a)$ (online network) and $\\hat{Q}(s,a)$ (target network), with random weights. Both networks estimate Q-values from state-action pairs. Also, set the exploration probability $\\epsilon$ to 1.0, and create an empty replay buffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Action Selection**: Use an epsilon-greedy strategy, just like in DQN. With a probability of $\\epsilon$, select a random action $a$, otherwise, select the action $a$ that yields the highest Q-value, i.e., $a = argmax_aQ(s,a)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Experience Collection**: Carry out the selected action $a$ in the environment to get the immediate reward $r$ and the next state $s'$.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Experience Storage**: Store the transition tuple $(s,a,r,s')$ in the replay buffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Sampling:** Randomly sample a mini-batch of transitions from the replay buffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Target Computation**: Here comes the primary difference from DQN. For every transition in the sampled mini-batch, compute the target value $y$. If the episode has ended, $y = r$. Otherwise, unlike DQN that uses the max operator to select the action from the target network, DDQN uses the online network to select the best action, and uses its Q-value estimate from the target network, i.e., $y = r + \\gamma \\hat{Q}(s', argmax_{a' \\in A} Q(s', a'))$. This double estimator approach helps to reduce overoptimistic value estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the loss as the squared difference between the predicted Q-value from the online network and the computed target, i.e., $\\mathcal{L} = (Q(s,a) - y)^2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Online Network Update**: Perform Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) on the online network to minimize the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Target Network Update**: Every $N$ steps, update the target network by copying the weights from the online network.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Iterate**: Repeat the process from step 2 until convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the key difference in DDQN lies in the way the target Q-value is calculated for non-terminal states during the update. DDQN chooses the action using the online network and estimates the Q-value for this action using the target network. This modification helps mitigate the issue of overestimation present in standard DQN.\n"

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Dueling DQN Algorithm\n",
        "1. **Initializatin**: In Dueling DQN, initialize the parameters of two neural networks, $Q(s,a)$ (online network) and $\\hat{Q}(s,a)$ (target network), with random weights. Unlike the traditional DQN, each network in Dueling DQN splits into two separate streams at some point - one for estimating the state-value function $V(s)$ and the other for estimating the advantage function $A(s,a)$. Also, set the exploration probability $\\epsilon$ to 1.0, and create an empty replay buffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Action Selection**: The action selection process is the same as DQN. Use an epsilon-greedy strategy. With a probability of $\\epsilon$, select a random action $a$, otherwise, select the action $a$ that yields the highest Q-value, i.e., $a = argmax_aQ(s,a)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Experience Collection**: Carry out the selected action $a$ in the environment to obtain the immediate reward $r$ and the next state $s'$.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Experience Storage**: Store the transition tuple $(s,a,r,s')$ in the replay buffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Sampling**: Randomly sample a mini-batch of transitions from the replay buffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Target Computation**: For each transition in the sampled mini-batch, compute the target value $y$. If the episode has ended, $y = r$. Otherwise, compute $y$ as $y = r + \\gamma \\hat{Q}(s', argmax_{a' \\in A} Q(s', a'))$.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the loss as the squared difference between the predicted Q-value from the online network and the computed target, i.e., $\\mathcal{L} = (Q(s,a) - y)^2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Online Network Update**: Use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or another optimization algorithm to update the online network and minimize the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Target Network Update**: Every $N$ steps, update the target network by copying the weights from the online network.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Iterate**: Repeat the process from step 2 until convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dueling DQN indeed introduces a novel network architecture for approximating the Q-value function. It separates the Q-value into two parts: the state-value function $V(s)$, which estimates the value of a state regardless of the actions, and the advantage function $A(s,a)$, which measures the relative advantage of taking an action in a state compared to the other actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "At first glance, it might seem logical to compute the Q-value simply by adding the state-value and the advantage: $Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a)$. However, this equation presents an issue: it's underdetermined. There are infinite possible combinations of $V(s)$ and $A(s,a)$ that satisfy this equation for a given $Q(s,a)$. For instance, if the actual value of $Q(s,a)$ is 10, we would have the equation $10 = V(s) + A(s,a)$, for which there are infinite solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors of the Dueling DQN paper propose a clever way to overcome this issue: they force the advantage function to have zero advantage at the chosen action. This means that the highest advantage, $A(s,a)$, is 0, and other advantages are negative or zero, thus providing a unique solution. To implement this, they modify the equation as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ Q(s,a) = V(s)+(A(s,a) − \\max_{a'}A(s, a') $$\n",
        "\n",
        "This equation means that the Q-value is computed as the state-value $V(s)$ plus the difference between the advantage of the action $a$ and the maximum advantage over all possible actions in state $s$. In other words, the Q-value is now the value of the state plus the relative advantage of taking the action $a$ over the other actions. This mechanism provides a clear way to train the network and allows Dueling DQN to learn efficiently about state values and action advantages.\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement this, we can use the original DQN algorithm and our original DQNAgent class, we just need to change the DQN it uses, in total just 2 lines of code changes in the agent class."
